    "#### In this assignment, we want to evaluate your ability to engineer features and design and evaluate a model. We will create a multi-class classification model to recommend medical plans to employees based on user data (inputs) and medical plan labels (outputs). We have access to data from ~250 users. Each user is classified into 1 of 3 plans by actuaries. \n",

    "- **qle**: qualifying life event that might incur costs (baby, medical procedure, married, moving)\n",
    "- **specialty_visits**: number of specalist visits last year \n",
    "- **exercises**: frequency of exercise (I exercise everyday, I exercise 3x a week, I don't exercise)\n",
    "- **savings**: if they had to pay $3000, how would they pay for this? (borrow money, have savings, HSA)\n",
    "- **label**: plan recommendation as indicated by actuary"
